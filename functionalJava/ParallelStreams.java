/**There are several factors to evaluate performance of a parallel stream.
-Size of data. The more bigger size of data => the greater speedup.
-Boxing/Unboxing. Primitive values are processed faster than boxed values.
-The number of cores are available at runtime. The more available cores => the greater speedup.
-Cost per element processing. The longer each element is processed => the more efficient parallelization. But it is not recommended to use parallel stream for performing too long operations (for example, network interconnection).
-Source data structure. Usually initial data source is a collection.
- The easier it is splited into parts => the greater speedup.
For example, ArrayList, arrays and IntStream.range() constructor are good sources for data splitting because they support random access.
Other, such as LinkedList, Stream.iterate are bad sources for data splitting.
-Type of operations: stateless or stateful.
Stateless operations (examples: filter, map) are better for parallel processing than stateful operations (examples: distinct, sorted, limit)ï»¿
 - operations based on order(findFirs, limit, findAny,skip) may perfrom more slowly in a parallel environment;
