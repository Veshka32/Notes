//There are several factors to evaluate performance of a parallel stream.
//Size of data. The more bigger size of data => the greater speedup.
//Boxing/Unboxing. Primitive values are processed faster than boxed values.
//The number of cores are available at runtime. The more available cores => the greater speedup.
//Cost per element processing. The longer each element is processed => the more efficient parallelization. But it is not recommended to use parallel stream for performing too long operations (for example, network interconnection).
//Source data structure. Usually initial data source is a collection.
// The easier it is splited into parts => the greater speedup.
// For example, ArrayList, arrays and IntStream.range() constructor are good sources for data splitting because they support random access.
// Other, such as LinkedList, Stream.iterate are bad sources for data splitting.
//Type of operations: stateless or stateful.
// Stateless operations (examples: filter, map) are better for parallel processing than stateful operations (examples: distinct, sorted, limit)ï»¿
